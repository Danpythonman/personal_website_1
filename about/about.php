<h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>

<p class="paragraph">
    I am Daniel Di Giovanni, and I am a 3rd year software engineering student at York University.
    I've always been fascinated by computers and engineering, especially how complex technical problems can be solved so elegantly.
    This curiosity motivates me not only in school, but also in studying on my own time.
    I often research aspects of computers and programming and apply this knowledge in projects I complete on my own.
    I hope to continue to hone my skills through school and my own endeavors to gain experience as a backend developer, where I can explore new technologies and contribute to solutions to complex problems.
